"The external 'bitly.com' service is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."
msgstr ""

msgid "This means you have to register an '%s' at their site first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The external 'turl' service is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The external 'ti.ny' service is used to register a short url for each "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The external 'cli.gs' service is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."

"The external 'is.gd' service is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The external 'tiny.cc' service is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No backend is used, direct links pointing to your ownCloud are generated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The service requires you to authenticate yourself by providing a valid "
"bit.ly user name and an '%s'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Such links are most likely longer than those generated when using a backend."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However this option does not rely on any third party service and keeps your "
"shortys under your control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since this setup depends on server based configuration rules the base url "
"can only be specified in the 'Admin' section of the configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static, rule-based backend, generates shorty links relative to a given base "
"url."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have to take care that any request to the url configured here is "
"internally mapped to the 'shorty' module."
msgstr ""

msgid "The target of that mapping must be some URL like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Have a try with the example link provided, click it, it should result in a "
"confirmation that your setup is working."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Leave empty if you can't provide a short base url that is mapped the "
"described way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only use this backend, if you can provide a short base url that is mapped "
"the described way. Your shorties won't work otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Googles external 'goo.gl service' is used to register a short url for each "
"generated shorty."
msgstr ""

msgid "You must provide a valid '%%s' to use this service."
msgstr ""

msgid "This means you require a 'Google API console account'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Register a new '%%s' at their pages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enabling the SMS option will offer sending a Shorty via SMS."
msgstr "开启短信功能即可通过短信发送短链"

msgid ""
"Unfortunately support for 'SMS url handling' is usually only found on mobile"
" devices like smart phones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, those implementations are minimalistic, buggy and differ from "
"system to system."
msgstr ""

msgid "In short: this might not work for you, therefore you can disable it…"
msgstr ""

msgid "Great, your setup appears to be working fine!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Requests to the configured base url are mapped to this ownClouds relay "
"service."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usage of that static backend is fine and safe as long as this setup is not "
"altered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This backend will now be offered as an additional backend alternative to all"
" local users inside their personal preferences."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorry, but your setup appears not to be working correctly yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please check your setup and make sure that the configured base url is indeed"
" correct."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure that all requests to it are somehow mapped to Shortys relay "
"service."
msgstr ""
